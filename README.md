# Chaos_vs_Periodicity_Predictor
The code analyzes time series data, extracting features like standard deviation and peak distance. Utilizing a RandomForest classifier, it predicts whether the underlying dynamical system exhibits periodic or chaotic behavior, offering insight into the system's temporal characteristics.

The code provided in the example is a simplified illustration and assumes that you have a one-dimensional time series data as input.
Here's a breakdown of the input:

Time Series Data (x):
The variable x represents a one-dimensional time series data. In the example, it's generated synthetically using a sine function plus some random noise. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this synthetic data with your actual time series data.

 Example time series data (replace with your data)
t = np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)
x = np.sin(t) + 0.1 * np.random.randn(1000)
Features (features):
Features are calculated from the time series data and are used as input for the machine learning classifier. In the example, some basic features are extracted, such as the standard deviation, mean, and mean peak distance.

 Example features for classification
peaks, _ = find_peaks(x)
mean_peak_distance = np.mean(np.diff(peaks))

features = [
    np.std(x),
    np.mean(x),
    mean_peak_distance,
]
Labels (labels):
Labels are associated with each set of features and indicate the type of dynamical system. In the example, labels are randomly assigned (0 or 1), where 0 represents periodic behavior, and 1 represents chaotic behavior.

 Example labels (0: periodic, 1: chaotic)
labels = [0 if np.random.rand() < 0.5 else 1 for _ in range(100)]
Training and Testing Sets (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test):
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning classifier. The train_test_split function is used for this purpose.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split([features], labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Classifier (classifier):
A RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn is used as the machine learning classifier. This classifier is trained on the training set (X_train, y_train) and then used to predict the type of dynamical system based on the features.

classifier = RandomForestClassifier()
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)
Prediction (prediction):
The trained classifier is used to predict the type of dynamical system based on the features extracted from the time series data.

prediction = classifier.predict([features])
Output (print statement):
The code outputs a message indicating whether the system appears to be periodic or chaotic based on the prediction made by the classifier.

if prediction[0] == 0:
    print("The system appears to be periodic.")
else:
    print("The system appears to exhibit chaotic behavior.")

In summary, the input to the code is a one-dimensional time series data (x), and the features extracted from this data are used to train a classifier to predict the type of dynamical system (periodic or chaotic). The example is meant to be a starting point, and you would adapt it based on your specific data and requirements.
